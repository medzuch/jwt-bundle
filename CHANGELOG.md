# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Configuration keys under `medzuch_jwt:` are public API: a rename or removal is
a breaking change and is recorded here with its deprecation path, the same way
a class or method signature would be.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing released yet — the package is in Phase 0 (skeleton). See
[`docs/plan.md`](docs/plan.md) §7 for the roadmap.

### Added

- Repository policy: contribution and security guidelines, PR template,
  Dependabot configuration for GitHub Actions, and branch/tag protection
  rulesets (`main` requires a pull request and merge commits; `v*` tags cannot
  be moved or deleted).
